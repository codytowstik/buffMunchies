# Buff Munchies
### About

  This is an open source project meant to develop a comprehensive app for CU students, by CU students. Anyone can contribute 
  and make pull requests to add/fix/change features. So far munch money tracking and general info has been implemented, but the
  general methodology is used to log in to most CU portals including D2L, myCUInfo, etc. Feel free to run the current app and 
  mess around with the code to get familiar. If you have any ideas for features or improvements, make a comment or implement
  them yourself! You don't need to have any Java experience to contribute, all code will be reviewed before merging and it is
  GREAT practice to just dive in.
  
### Coding Standards
