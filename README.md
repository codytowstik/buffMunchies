# Buff Munchies
### About

  Application originally built during a Hack CU Hackathon in 2016. Students got 15-19 meal swipes a week, only 4 could be used per day. It wasn't uncommon to lose track of how many swipes you had, since most people didn't even know about the portal that
  could be used to check, and the UI was awful. 
  
  This app requires a student account to work (and probably doesn't work many years later), but provided an interface to
  simply check the amount of meal swipes left and to see how much "munch money" was left.
  
  I fondly remember this project as my first attempt to stay up programming for 36 hours straight, and is probably why I
  can no longer drink Red Bull.
  
# If ...

you are interested in browsing the code, I suggest taking a look at the [single MainActivity.java](./FoodTracker/app/src/main/java/com/talks/towtie/foodtracker/MainActivity.java) that essentially implements the entire app.

# Instructions (when it used to work):

1. Download Android Studio and set up emulators (Google for a guide on how to do this, and try a 'Hello World' app)
2. Choose 'Open...' or a similar option to open an existing project
3. Navigate to the FoodTracker, it should have a green Android Studio icon next to it
4. Voila... you should be able to click the green 'Run' arrow and the app should start up
